workspace
2. 01-migrate-domain.sh - Migrates domain entities, value objects, services, events, and 
aggregates
3. 02-migrate-application.sh - Migrates commands, queries, handlers, validators, and DTOs
4. 03-migrate-infrastructure.sh - Migrates repositories, external services, and messaging 
infrastructure
5. 04-migrate-presentation.sh - Consolidates web components, pages, API controllers, and mappers
6. 05-migrate-shared-kernel.sh - Creates common utilities, base classes, types, and exceptions
7. 06-migrate-configuration.sh - Consolidates package.json, configs, Docker, and deployment 
files
8. 07-migrate-testing.sh - Migrates and creates comprehensive test suite
9. 08-update-dependencies.sh - Updates imports, resolves dependencies, creates DI container
10. 09-create-startup.sh - Creates application bootstrap, middleware, and error handling
11. 10-cleanup-old-structure.sh - Safely removes old monorepo structure after validation
12. 11-validate-migration.sh - Comprehensive validation of completed migration

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Run Complete Migration (Recommended)
bash
./migration-scripts/run-all-migrations.sh


### Option 2: Run Individual Steps
bash
./migration-scripts/00-prepare-migration.sh
./migration-scripts/01-migrate-domain.sh
# ... continue with each step


## 🎯 What Each Script Does

### **Preparation & Analysis**
• Creates complete backup at ../v3-backup/
• Analyzes current codebase and creates inventory
• Maps domain concepts and service boundaries
• Sets up migration workspace with tracking

### **Domain Layer Migration**
• Extracts and consolidates domain entities (User, Auth, etc.)
• Creates value objects (Email, UserId, etc.)
• Migrates domain services and creates new ones
• Implements domain events and aggregate roots
• Follows DDD patterns and best practices

### **Application Layer Migration**
• Creates CQRS commands and queries
• Implements command/query handlers
• Adds validation logic and DTOs
• Sets up application event handlers
• Maintains clean separation of concerns

### **Infrastructure Migration**
• Consolidates database repositories with interfaces
• Migrates external service integrations
• Creates messaging infrastructure
• Sets up dependency injection container
• Implements proper abstraction layers

### **Presentation Migration**
• Consolidates React components from all frontend apps
• Merges pages and creates unified structure
• Migrates API controllers with proper error handling
• Creates mappers for clean data transformation
• Sets up routing and middleware

### **Configuration & Dependencies**
• Creates single consolidated package.json
• Updates all import statements to use path aliases
• Resolves dependency conflicts
• Sets up TypeScript, ESLint, Jest configurations
• Creates Docker and deployment configurations

### **Testing & Validation**
• Migrates existing tests and creates new ones
• Sets up unit, integration, and E2E test suites
• Creates test utilities and mocks
• Validates entire migration with comprehensive checks
• Ensures everything works correctly

## 🎉 Key Benefits

### **Before (Complex Monorepo)**
• 23+ directories with scattered functionality
• Multiple package.json files with conflicting dependencies
• Complex import paths and circular dependencies
• Difficult to maintain and understand
• Enterprise features spread across multiple systems

### **After (Clean DDD Architecture)**
• Single, well-organized src/ directory
• Clear separation of Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation
• Consolidated dependencies and clean imports
• Easy to test, maintain, and extend
• Production-ready with comprehensive tooling

## 📊 Migration Features

• **🔒 Safe**: Creates backup before any changes
• **📊 Tracked**: Progress tracking and status reporting
• **🔍 Validated**: Comprehensive validation at each step
• **📝 Documented**: Detailed reports and documentation
• **🛡️ Robust**: Error handling and rollback capabilities
• **⚡ Efficient**: Automated with manual oversight points

## 🎯 Expected Timeline
• **Automated execution**: ~30-45 minutes
• **Manual review/fixes**: 2-4 hours
• **Testing & validation**: 1-2 hours
• **Total**: 4-6 hours for complete migration

The scripts handle the heavy lifting automatically while providing checkpoints for manual 
review and validation. You'll end up with a clean, maintainable, production-ready Domain-Driven
Design architecture!
