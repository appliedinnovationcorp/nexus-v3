# Compliance Architecture Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive compliance solution using best-of-breed FOSS technologies:

- **GDPR Compliance**: Data anonymization, consent management, and data subject rights
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls framework with continuous monitoring
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails with tamper-proof logging
- **Data Retention**: Automated data lifecycle management and purging
- **Privacy by Design**: Built-in privacy controls and data minimization
