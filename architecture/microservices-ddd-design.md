# Microservices & Domain-Driven Design Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines a best-of-breed FOSS-only solution implementing:
- Hexagonal Architecture with Domain Boundaries
- Event-Driven Architecture with Apache Kafka
- CQRS Pattern Implementation
- Kong API Gateway
- Kuma Service Mesh

## Architecture Components

### 1. Domain Services Structure
```
services/
├── user-domain/           # User Management Bounded Context
├── order-domain/          # Order Management Bounded Context
├── inventory-domain/      # Inventory Management Bounded Context
├── payment-domain/        # Payment Processing Bounded Context
├── notification-domain/   # Notification Service
└── shared-kernel/         # Shared Domain Models
```

### 2. Technology Stack
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka + Zookeeper
- **API Gateway**: Kong Gateway
- **Service Mesh**: Kuma (by Kong)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (per service)
- **Event Store**: EventStore DB
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Tracing**: Jaeger
- **Service Discovery**: Consul

### 3. Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous**: HTTP/REST via Kong Gateway
- **Asynchronous**: Apache Kafka Events
- **Service-to-Service**: gRPC via Kuma mesh
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models with event sourcing

## Implementation Details

### Hexagonal Architecture
Each domain service follows the hexagonal (ports and adapters) pattern:
- **Domain Core**: Business logic and entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External adapters (DB, messaging, etc.)
- **Presentation Layer**: API controllers and DTOs

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Domain events published to Kafka topics
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Event replay capabilities for system recovery

### CQRS Implementation
- Command handlers for write operations
- Query handlers for read operations
- Separate read/write databases
- Event-driven synchronization between models
