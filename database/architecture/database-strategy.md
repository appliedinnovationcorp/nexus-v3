# Database Architecture Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive database architecture using best-of-breed FOSS solutions:

- **OLTP Database**: PostgreSQL with sharding and read replicas
- **Analytics Database**: ClickHouse for OLAP workloads
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer for PostgreSQL, ClickHouse native pooling
- **Migrations**: Flyway for schema versioning and rollbacks
- **Backup & Recovery**: pg_basebackup, WAL-E, Point-in-Time Recovery
- **Monitoring**: PostgreSQL Exporter, ClickHouse metrics

## Architecture Components

### 1. Multi-Database Strategy
```
OLTP Layer (PostgreSQL)
├── Primary Database (Write)
├── Read Replicas (Read)
└── Sharded Instances (Scale)

Analytics Layer (ClickHouse)
├── Distributed Tables
├── Materialized Views
└── Real-time Data Ingestion

Connection Management
├── PgBouncer (PostgreSQL)
├── HAProxy (Load Balancing)
└── Connection Pooling
```

### 2. Data Flow
```
Application → PgBouncer → PostgreSQL Primary → WAL → Read Replicas
                                          ↓
                                    Change Data Capture
                                          ↓
                                    ClickHouse (Analytics)
```

### 3. Sharding Strategy
- **Horizontal Sharding**: By user_id, tenant_id, or date ranges
- **Shard Key Selection**: Even distribution and query patterns
- **Cross-Shard Queries**: Application-level aggregation
- **Shard Management**: Automated rebalancing and scaling

### 4. Backup & Recovery
- **Continuous WAL Archiving**: Real-time backup to S3-compatible storage
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restore to any point within retention period
- **Automated Backups**: Daily full backups, continuous incremental
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Disaster recovery setup
